    "For example, when creating an ensemble model based on several decision trees, which are simple yet high-variance models (often considered 'weak learners'), we need to aggregate them to enhance their resistance to data variations. Therefore, it makes sense to train the trees separately, allowing each one to adapt to different parts of the dataset. This way, each tree gains knowledge about various data variations, collectively improving the ensemble's predictive performance."

    "**Bagging**: It is generally done with homogeneous predictors, each one operating independently in relation to the others, in a parallel manner. The final algorithm is then constructed by aggregating the results obtained from the base models in some form of average. Random Forest is one of the most famous algorithm.\n",
